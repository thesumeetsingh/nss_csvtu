       The NSS symbol is embossed on NSS Badge. The N.S.S.
        volunteers wear it while undertaking various
        community programs of community service. There are
        24 wheels in 'Rathi of Sun Temple of Konark. Each
        wheel has eight bars, which represents 8 pahars of day.
        Hence the badge reminds the wearer to be in readiness
        for service of the nation round the clock i.e. for 24
        hours.
        The RED colour in the badge indicates that the NSS
        volunteers are full of blood, i.e. lively, active an
        spirited.
        The NAVY BLUE colour indicated the cosmos of which
        the NSS is a tiny part ready to contribute its share for
        the welfare of mankind.
